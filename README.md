# FusionMC
## The fusion of multiple Minecraft optimization methods.
hey there! my name is Arthur, and I'm currently working on an ambitious Minecraft optimization mod called FusionMC.

this is by far my biggest project yet — I'm putting in a lot of effort to help players with low-end PCs (or anyone who just wants more FPS) get the best possible performance.

my goal? to make this mod even better than Sodium. to do that, I’ve been diving deep into Fabric, Loom, Yarn, and other tools to understand the internals of Minecraft.

but enough about me — here’s what you really came for:

# Mod Details
- **Total hours spent**: 87+

- **Optimizations planned**: frustum culling, improved chunk rendering, culling for leaves and particles, entity and tile entity culling, animation sleeping, better lighting engine

- **Currently implemented**: frustum culling, improved chunk rendering

- **Latest version**: `0.1.1d-beta+mc1.20.1`

# How to use (in-game)

- as simple as that: just put the .jar downloaded on [**CurseForge**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods) or [**Modrinth**](https://modrinth.com/mods) on the Minecraft mods folder and play!

# How to use (IDEs, modifying)

- 1. download the project here
- 2. open the project in an IDE
- 3. do whatever you want to do with it!
